#Using a service worker for serving images from the user's local machine

Sometimes it is desirable to display in a browser images that the user has selected from their local file system. For example, when you want to give them a preview of an image before giving them the option to upload to the server.
  A common technique for doing this is to convert the image a data url and set this as the value of an image element's src attribute. The draw back of this technique is that you have to use a url that is different from that which you will probably use on a normal page to request the image once it is on your server. Imagine you are creating a WYSIWYG editor for a CMS which allows the user to write HTML and also has a pane which gives a preview of what it will look like. There are two possible solutions: Firstly, you could use the aforementioned technique. This would mean that you have to do some work to change the image urls at some point. Possible, but a bit hacky perhaps. Alternatively you could upload the images to the server straight away. But if the user then cancels the edit you are left with images on the server that you need to get rid of somehow. Again possible, but messy. Is their a better way?
  
What we want is to be able to construct a URL such as will reference our future uploaded image on the server. Then construct an image tag which will use this URL to request the image and then - magically - receive it! Impossible surely!!

Not anymore. With service workers we can make this dream a reality. A service worker is a web worker which acts as a kind of proxy server within the browser. It can be configured to intercept requests that we make on the network and return whatever we like, fetching the resource from the network, a cache, or even an IndexedDB database. 

This is what allows us to achieve our goal. Before we converted an image file to a data url, but now we instead store it into an indexedDB database. IndexedDB database are happily accessible from a service worker. Then a fetch event handler within the service worker regexes the request url and if it finds the resource in the database will return it, otherwise it will request it from the network. 

See link to a demonstration app.

The editor is split into two panes. The left one is for inputting raw html. The right hand pane displays the html as a browser would (as this browser is doing!) If you start to type an image tag ('<img ') into the editor pane a pop up will appear offering you to pick an image from your file system. It also gives fields for filename and alt text. Assuming you pick an image and click the 'done' button, the editor will automatically complete the image element with the correct values for src and alt attributes dependent on your input. The display pane will update including the image.This is the image that has been served from the indexedDB database by the service worker. In a production app, the user would then be able to sumbit the entire form to the server and obviously you would have to make sure the image was stored in the correct folder matching the url in our tag. This demo app doesn't do this but it would be fairly trivial to instruct a back end developer to write this for you!
